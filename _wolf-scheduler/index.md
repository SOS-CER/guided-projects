# WolfScheduler 

The course schedule for the next semester has been released and you take some time to explore possible schedules of courses that you're interested in taking that will let you optimize sleep, meals, and time for yourself and friends.  However, tracking all of the schedule information manually is tedious.  Wouldn't it be easier if there was a tool that let you select which classes you're interested in taking, let you know if classes are conflicting, if there would be issues with travel between campuses, and let you plan your extracurricular activities?  There may be some tools out there that let you explore these options, but with your programming knowledge, you can create a custom scheduling tool for you and your friends.
