# CSC 216 Software Development Fundamentals

CSC216 is a second semester programming course at NC State University.  The course focuses on using software engineering skills to solve small programming problems associated with advanced OO, linear data structures, and finite state machine.  Programming techniques like recursion are used to solve problems.

Upon successful completion of CSC 216, students will be able to...
  * Describe the utility of inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism in object-oriented systems, and design, implement, and test programs which use these language features;
  * Identify the phases of a simple model of the software life cycle, and employ these phases in developing software;
  * Describe basic design modeling techniques, including UML class diagrams and simple design patterns (e.g., model/view/controller), and indicate how and when to use them;
  * Identify and compare the basic kinds of software testing, describe when to use each method, and design and implement test code;
  * Navigate and extract information from the Java API, and employ the Javadoc tool to construct internal documentation of source code;
  * Use software engineering best practices like pair programming, test-driven development, code coverage, static analysis, version control, continuous integration, and documentation with supporting tooling to design, implement, and test object-oriented systems.
  * Design, implement, and test a finite state machine;
  * Identify when recursion is useful, and design, implement, and test recursive algorithms and simple recursive data structures;
  * Implement, test, and use a stack, queue, array-based list, and linked list.
